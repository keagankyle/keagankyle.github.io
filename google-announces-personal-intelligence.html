            <h2>Google Announces “Personal Intelligence”</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p>Google has new plans for the new year! In January 2026 Google launched a major update for Gemini AI called personal intelligence[cite: 405]. This allows Gemini to move beyond generic writing assistance by allowing the AI to learn a user’s specific habits, preferences, and writing style to provide a more tailored experience to the individual across gmail and google docs[cite: 406].</p>

            <p>This feature allows Gemini to remember specific context from past conversations and documents to improve its writing suggestions[cite: 408]. Rather than drafting a standard professional email, AI can now tailor to your specific level of formality, common sign-offs, and preferred formatting[cite: 409].</p>

            <p>This feature highlights the trend of hyper-personalization[cite: 410]. The past couple of years AI writing often sounded robotic or “too perfect”[cite: 411]. But with the integration of personalization directly into the writing process, Google is attempting to avoid this[cite: 412]. Overall putting Google into the competition of more “human-like” writing styles[cite: 413].</p>

            <p>With the continuous and growing use of AI our society has with everything, this update for Gemini can be very helpful especially for drafting emails and online communication in the professional world[cite: 415]. However this also raises an ethical question, if AI can mimic your writing voice to draft emails, at what point does “your” communication and writing style stop being “yours”[cite: 416]? While I still think this will be useful and widely utilized in our society as it saves a lot of time, does this also pose a risk that professional relationships and communication could potentially become “bot-to-bot” conversations with no actual individual writing back and forth occurring[cite: 417]?</p>
