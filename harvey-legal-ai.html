            <h2>Harvey AI: The Rise of the “Source-Assured” Legal Assistant</h2>
            <p class="date">January 31, 2026</p>

            <h3>Opening: What’s New</h3>
            <p>Harvey AI has solidified its position as the premier generative AI Platform built specifically for the legal industry[cite: 381]. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, Harvey is a domain-specific powerhouse designed to handle the complex reasoning and security requirements of high-stakes legal work[cite: 382]. Backed by OpenAI, the platform recently expanded its "Vault" feature, allowing legal teams to analyze up to 10,000 documents simultaneously to extract deep insights in a fraction of the time it would take a human reviewer[cite: 383].</p>

            <h3>Details: Key Features & Tools</h3>
            <p>The platform features an "Assistant" for precision research, allowing lawyers to query the system in plain English to summarize documents, compare legal opinions, or track real-time legislative developments[cite: 385]. For massive data ingestion, "The Vault" chews through thousands of discovery documents or contracts to identify patterns, missing provisions, or regulatory risks with specialized one-click workflows[cite: 386]. Furthermore, a landmark partnership with OpenAI led to a custom model trained on the equivalent of 10 billion tokens of U.S. case law to reduce hallucinations and ensure legal accuracy[cite: 387]. Critically, every answer generated is "source-assured," meaning it is anchored to verifiable sources with sentence-level citations for instant fact-checking[cite: 388].</p>

            <h3>Context: Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>Harvey is a leading example of the shift from "Software as a Service" (SaaS) to "Work as a Service" (WaaS), as it performs the labor-intensive tasks of due diligence and case assessment rather than just providing a writing interface[cite: 390]. By integrating directly into essential tools like Microsoft Word and Outlook, it reflects the broader 2026 trend of Human-AI Alliances[cite: 391]. In this model, the AI acts as a sophisticated digital intern that never sleeps, enabling human lawyers to shift their focus away from manual data crunching and toward high-level strategy and client advocacy[cite: 392].</p>

            <h3>Your Take</h3>
            <p>Harvey solves the biggest problem with using AI in law by focusing on trust and accuracy instead of just speed[cite: 394]. By making it easy to see exactly where information comes from, this tool ensures that lawyers aren't just starting with a "blank page"[cite: 395]. It is a total game-changer because it takes over the most boring parts of research, which saves a massive amount of time and lets attorneys focus on the work that actually earns them billable hours[cite: 396]. For example, it could sort through thousands of pages of medical records to find the exact dates or specific doctor records needed for a case in seconds[cite: 397]. While humans still need to double-check everything for ethical reasons, turning a month of manual reading into one day of work is a huge step forward for legal efficiency[cite: 398].</p>
