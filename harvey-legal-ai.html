            <p>Harvey AI has solidified its position as the premier generative AI Platform built specifically for the legal industry. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, Harvey is a domain-specific powerhouse designed to handle the complex reasoning and security requirements of high-stakes legal work. Backed by OpenAI, the platform recently expanded its "Vault" feature, allowing legal teams to analyze up to 10,000 documents simultaneously to extract deep insights in a fraction of the time it would take a human reviewer.</p>

            <p>The platform features an "Assistant" for precision research, allowing lawyers to query the system in plain English to summarize documents, compare legal opinions, or track real-time legislative developments. For massive data ingestion, "The Vault" chews through thousands of discovery documents or contracts to identify patterns, missing provisions, or regulatory risks with specialized one-click workflows. Furthermore, a landmark partnership with OpenAI led to a custom model trained on the equivalent of 10 billion tokens of U.S. case law to reduce hallucinations and ensure legal accuracy. Critically, every answer generated is "source-assured," meaning it is anchored to verifiable sources with sentence-level citations for instant fact-checking.</p>

            <p>Harvey is a leading example of the shift from "Software as a Service" (SaaS) to "Work as a Service" (WaaS), as it performs the labor-intensive tasks of due diligence and case assessment rather than just providing a writing interface. By integrating directly into essential tools like Microsoft Word and Outlook, it reflects the broader 2026 trend of Human-AI Alliances. In this model, the AI acts as a sophisticated digital intern that never sleeps, enabling human lawyers to shift their focus away from manual data crunching and toward high-level strategy and client advocacy.</p>

            <p>Harvey solves the biggest problem with using AI in law by focusing on trust and accuracy instead of just speed. By making it easy to see exactly where information comes from, this tool ensures that lawyers aren't just starting with a "blank page". It is a total game-changer because it takes over the most boring parts of research, which saves a massive amount of time and lets attorneys focus on the work that actually earns them billable hours. For example, it could sort through thousands of pages of medical records to find the exact dates or specific doctor records needed for a case in seconds. While humans still need to double-check everything for ethical reasons, turning a month of manual reading into one day of work is a huge step forward for legal efficiency.</p>
